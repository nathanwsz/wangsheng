    "abstract": "Large volumes of online impressions are sold daily via real-time auctions to deliver targeted ads to consumers. Advertisers use data to learn about user preferences and select the most appropriate ad for each user, which also helps them optimize their bids in an ad auction. While ad exchanges may provide some user data to advertisers, it is usually limited, and advertisers often acquire data from various sources to improve targeting performance. The acquisition of such data can significantly influence the revenue of the ad exchange, which has mainly been passive about advertisers' data acquisition process. Previous studies have examined the impact of ad exchanges revealing their data to advertisers, but little attention has been paid to the active role that ad exchanges can play when advertisers acquire data themselves. To address this gap, we propose three subsidy frameworks to increase ad exchange revenue by inducing more advertisers to acquire data: All-subsidized (AS), Winner-subsidized (WS), and Loser-subsidized (LS). Using a stylized game-theoretic model, we analyze the impact of subsidy provisions on the platform's net revenue. Our results show that WS can be better or worse than AS, depending on the cost of data acquisition, its beneficial impact on ad selection, and how impression value is distributed. We also consider an extension of our model wherein advertisers have heterogeneous abilities to leverage data for targeting and analyze how this heterogeneity affects the platform's revenue under the optimal subsidy framework.",

    "abstract": "The growing online retail market has led to the prevalence of multichannel retailing. Meanwhile, retailers are increasingly combining multichannel retailing with a multibranding strategy. While this can further increase the retailer's sales, it brings new advertising challenges. Multibrand, multichannel retailers usually launch advertising campaigns for different brands on multiple media. Thus, the retailer's advertising efforts fall into a set of brand-media units. Each unit's advertising efforts can affect the sales of all brands on all channels. Therefore, retailers need to coordinate the advertising efforts of different units to maximize advertising efficiency in propelling sales. So far, the optimization problem of multibrand, multimedia advertising has not been analyzed in the literature, and our study aims to bridge this gap. We develop a stochastic differential equation model to estimate the impact of multimedia advertising on sales in a multibrand, multichannel context. Using the data from a jewelry retailer in the U.S., we show that our model is effective in predicting future sales driven by advertising. Afterward, we formulate the advertising optimization problems under four coordination strategies: (i) non-coordination, (ii) brand coordination, (iii) media coordination, and (iv) global coordination. By solving the problem for each strategy, the retailers can obtain the optimal expenditure for each unit under that strategy. Finally, we compare the retailerâ€™s profits under four strategies. Interestingly, we find that brand or media coordination may result in a profit lower than non-coordination. Our findings provide insights regarding the selection of coordination strategies for multibrand, multichannel retailers with multimedia advertising campaigns, especially when they cannot do global coordination.",

    "authors": "<b>Wangsheng Zhu</b>, Jiahui Mo, Syam Menon, and Sumit Sarkar",
    "status": "Major revision at Information Systems Research",
    "abstract": "Crowdsourcing contests are popular mechanisms for firms to obtain solutions to tasks from external sources. Platforms allow firms to select from various features they make available, in addition to setting essential contest attributes like prize amounts and duration. The combination of features selected when posting a contest can have a significant impact on the probability that it will succeed in attracting acceptable solutions. This study develops a framework that first identifies an effective prediction model, and then incorporates it into an optimization model to maximize the predicted probability that a crowdsourcing contest will succeed. Since the outcome of a contest depends not just on its own design but also on the other contests on the platform, we consider both contest and environmental attributes as inputs to the prediction model, while allowing for interactions among them. Motivated by practices commonly observed on such platforms, we formulate several versions of the contest design problem as variants of the mixed linear and nonlinear knapsack problems. We identify useful analytical properties that help interpret the optimal solution (and thereby, the basis for making the recommendation), and propose solution procedures. We validate our framework using data collected from a leading crowdsourcing contest platform. The results from computational experiments leveraging our findings show that the contest designs recommended by the proposed framework can increase predicted success probabilities significantly relative to seeker-specified designs.",

    "status": "Work-in-progress",
    "abstract": "The digitization of billboards has facilitated the sale of advertising slots through real-time auctions. Consequently, there has been a rise in the number of agents who assist advertisers in bidding and acquiring these slots. These agents enter into contracts with advertisers to secure a specific number of slots within designated time periods. To fulfill these contracts, agents participate in auctions to win the desired slots. However, accepting numerous contracts may require the agent to place higher bids in auctions, potentially impacting their profitability. Therefore, it is crucial to strike a balance between contract acceptance and the bidding strategy employed.<br>Motivated by these observations, we address two key aspects: (1) identifying the optimal set of advertisers for the agent to contract with, and (2) determining the appropriate bidding strategy based on the contracted advertisers' demands. We formulate a two-stage optimization problem for agents, followed by the proposal of a near-optimal solution to the bidding optimization problem. Through this near-optimal solution, we demonstrate that the objective function in the resulting advertiser selection problem exhibits the properties of a submodular set function. To solve the advertiser selection problem, we introduce a greedy algorithm.",

    "abstract": "As ad revenue continues to soar, publishers like Google and Amazon face the challenge of optimizing ad selection to maximize their earnings. Previous researches assumed customers click on ads once with decaying possibilities over time. However, it's been observed that repeated exposure to an ad increases interest and potential purchase consideration. To account for this, we generalize the previous model by allowing ads to be repeated in multiple positions. Additionally, existing models assume that users permanently leave the ad session after clicking an ad. Our framework accommodates more complex user behavior, enabling users to return to the previous ad list even after clicking an ad. Our model considers various factors affecting click probabilities, including ad quality, position, and previously displayed ads. We have developed efficient algorithms with guaranteed optimal or approximate solutions.",
